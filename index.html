<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #46466d;">The first six months of his election
Caused the most changes to immigration policies, one of these
Was  to enhance vetting, causing stricter policies for visas
Applicants.</p>

<p2>This Executive Order limits birthright citizenship. To acquire U.S. citizenship automatically, children born on or after February 19, 2025, in the U.S. must have at least one parent who is a Legal Permanent Resident (green card holder) or a U.S. citizen
Some critics speculate that this could lead to foreign nations applying for visas at US embassies, which may result in some being suspended or delayed, making it harder for individuals to enter the country. Positive impacts, some speculate, could lower the crime rate and save taxpayer money. People who are Republicans are more likely to see the good sides, while democrats are more critical of Donald Trump's views. Overall, Donald Trump's view on immigration is nothing short of hostile, viewing immigrants as criminals and high risk. “Since President Trump returned to office, ICE has deported nearly 200,000 illegal aliens, including 47,885 with charges or convictions for assault, 16,552 with charges or convictions for sexual assaults, and 2,699 with charges or convictions for homicides.</p2>
